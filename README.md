## My process
Basic HTML Structure was constructed first. 
Styling was then added to match the given image as closely as possible.
### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Button

### What I learned
1. <s> tag is used to strikethrough words.
2. Following code can be used to add space after awesome font
 fa-cart-shopping::after{
    content: "__";
    opacity: 0;
}
3. Following code lets an image maintain its aspect ratio while filling the entire div-
.image img{
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}




To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css

.proud-of-this-css {
border-radius: 0 10px 10px 0; // for four corners of the div
}
.margin{
    width: 2vw; //Instead of adding separate equal margins for all divs,
     an entire new div was inserted and display was made as flex. This created equal margins for all divs on LHS
}


### Continued development

I am not at all comfortable with responsiveness of the sites.
